### Research Interests
The overarching focus of my research is on the causes and consequences of women’s representation with a particular focus on the Middle East and North Africa. More specifically, I am interested in studying how (and which) women gain leadership positions in political parties and the effect of women’s presence on citizen’s attitudes and behaviors. 

### Questions I hope to answer
Which women gain leadership positions in secular and religious parties? What determines which women run, where (i.e. district location) they run, and their position on party lists?

Do female politicians interact with constituents differently than their male colleagues? Is this conditional on party affiliation or quota type? Are citizens more loyal to regimes that enact gender quotas? Are women more interested in politics when represented by a woman instead of a male?

### Methods
Various regression models including hierarchical models, survey experiments, text analysis, and qualitative methods (primarily interviews and focus groups).

### Relevent data

- Arab Barometer ( [data](http://www.arabbarometer.org/survey-data/) )

- World Values Survey ( [data](http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/WVSContents.jsp) )

- Afro Barometer ( [data](http://www.afrobarometer.org/data) )

- Quota Adoption and Reform over Time (QAROT) dataset ( [data](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/100918/version/V1/view) )

- Tunisia Election Data (results by district available [here](http://tunisiaelectiondata.com/) )

### Something cool

Using Arab Barometer data to evaluate attitudes towards female leaders. In particular, I evaluate respondent's attitudes regarding whether "men are better at political leadership than women":

```{r ABIV_data}
#loading data
d <- read.csv(here("data/ABIV_English_subset.csv"))

#naming things and recoding leader variable (so higher values indicate more gender egalitarian views)
d$leader <- as.numeric(d$q6013)
d$leader[as.numeric(d$q6013) == 3] <- 2
d$leader[as.numeric(d$q6013) == 4] <- 3
d$leader[as.numeric(d$q6013) == 5] <- 1
d$leader[as.numeric(d$q6013) == 6] <- 4
d$leader[as.numeric(d$q6013) < 3] <- NA


d$female <- as.numeric(d$q1002)
d$female[as.numeric(d$q1002) == 2] <- 0
d$female <- as.factor(d$female)

#age by category
d$age_cat <- as.numeric(d$q1001)
d$age_cat[as.numeric(d$q1001) == 74] <- NA
d$age_cat[as.numeric(d$q1001) < 8] <- 1
d$age_cat[as.numeric(d$q1001) > 7 & as.numeric(d$q1001) < 18] <- 2
d$age_cat[as.numeric(d$q1001) > 17 & as.numeric(d$q1001) < 28] <- 3
d$age_cat[as.numeric(d$q1001) > 27 & as.numeric(d$q1001) < 38] <- 4
d$age_cat[as.numeric(d$q1001) > 37 & as.numeric(d$q1001) < 48] <- 5
d$age_cat[as.numeric(d$q1001) > 47 & as.numeric(d$q1001) < 74] <- 6


```

```{r additional vars, include=FALSE}
d %>%
  group_by(female) %>% 
  mutate(leader_meanf = mean(leader, na.rm = TRUE))

head(d$leader_meanf)

```
<!-- Unclear what I'm doing wrong in the chunk of code above. Trying to make a var that is the mean response by gender. -->


Mean response by gender and age with higher values indicating more gender egalitarian views (i.e., less supportive of the statement that "men are better at political leadership than women"):
```{r means}

#Mean response by gender
d %>%
  group_by(female) %>% summarise(leader = mean(leader, na.rm=TRUE))


#Mean response by age
d %>%
  group_by(age_cat) %>% summarise(leader = mean(leader, na.rm=TRUE))

```
