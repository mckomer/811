### Research Interests
The overarching focus of my research is on the causes and consequences of women’s representation with a particular focus on the Middle East and North Africa. More specifically, I am interested in studying how (and which) women gain leadership positions in political parties and the effect of women’s presence on citizen’s attitudes and behaviors. 

### Questions I hope to answer
Which women gain leadership positions in secular and religious parties? What determines which women run, where (i.e. district location) they run, and their position on party lists?

Do female politicians interact with constituents differently than their male colleagues? Is this conditional on party affiliation or quota type? Are citizens more loyal to regimes that enact gender quotas? Are women more interested in politics when represented by a woman instead of a male?

### Methods
Various regression models including hierarchical models, survey experiments, text analysis, and qualitative methods (primarily interviews and focus groups).
